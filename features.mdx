## Content Organization and Hierarchy

You structure your documentation using folders, pages, and subpages. Create a clear hierarchy that mirrors your project's architecture. Drag and drop pages to reorder, and use frontmatter for metadata.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Structure" icon="folder-plus">
    Start with a root workspace. Add pages via the sidebar.

# docs/workspace.mdx

  <Tab title="Web Editor" icon="globe">
    Access at `https://dashboard.example.com/docs` for browser-based editing.
  </Tab>

## Versioning and History Tracking

Chamely tracks every change with Git under the hood. View diffs, blame, and revert commits easily.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
````bash
# View history
chamely history docs/features.mdx
````

```javascript
// Fetch versions via API
const versions = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/docs/features.mdx/versions');
```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Control" default-open="false">
  Integrate with GitHub for pull requests and reviews.

  ```javascript
  // Webhook for auto-sync
  {
    "event": "push",
    "repo": "your-docs-repo",
    "branch": "main"
  }
  ```
</Expandable>

## Search and Navigation Tools

Search across all docs with fuzzy matching. Use table of contents, breadcrumbs, and sidebar navigation for quick access.

| Feature | Description | Shortcut |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Global Search | Finds across workspaces | `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>` |
| Page TOC | Auto-generated outline | Sidebar toggle |
| Breadcrumbs | Path navigation | Top bar |

Navigate hierarchies effortlessly. Pin frequent pages for faster access.
