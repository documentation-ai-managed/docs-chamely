## Benefits for Project Teams

You gain efficiency by centralizing documentation, which cuts down search time and ensures everyone accesses the latest versions. Teams report faster onboarding for new members—reduce ramp-up from weeks to days. Collaboration features foster knowledge sharing, minimizing silos.

For developers, integrate docs with code repos via webhooks to `https://api.example.com/docs/webhook`. Project managers appreciate analytics on doc views and engagement.
